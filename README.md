- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the term "robot" was first introduced by the Czech playwright Karel Čapek in his 1920 play "R.U.R." (Rossum's Universal Robots)? The word "robot" comes from the Czech word "robota," which means "forced labor" or "drudgery." It's fascinating to think that a term coined in a work of fiction has become so deeply ingrained in our language and associated with the field of robotics and coding today!
